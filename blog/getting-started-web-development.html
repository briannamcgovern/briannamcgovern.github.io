                <p>Starting your journey in web development can feel overwhelming at first. With so many technologies, frameworks, and learning resources available, it's hard to know where to begin. In this post, I'll share my experience and provide a structured approach to learning web development.</p>

                <h2>1. Start with the Fundamentals</h2>

                    <li><strong>Traditional Education:</strong> Computer science degrees with web development focus</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Build Projects</h2>
